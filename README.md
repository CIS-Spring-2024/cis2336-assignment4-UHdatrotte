This project is a website for the cafeteria at the UH Sugarland campus.

The website includes frontend and backend capabilities.

The web pages include a biography of the website creator (Desmond Trotter), a home page, a menu page, and an order form page.

All pages include Javascript feedback forms at the bottom of each page. The entry is logged in the console.

The Menu page includes an external javascript file that drops down each menu item.

The Order page includes an external javascript file that adds each item to the shopping cart. Clients can increment/decrement shopping cart items and the total is calculated. A client can increase the item count up to 10. The client can also decrease the item count to 0, which removes the item from the cart.

Once the client is done with the order, the 'Order Submit' button transfers the client to an order confirmation page.
